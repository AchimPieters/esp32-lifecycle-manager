config LCM_RESTART_THRESHOLD
    int "Power-cycle threshold for automatic factory reset"
    range 2 30
    default 10
    help
        Defines how many consecutive power-cycle resets trigger the factory
        recovery routine. The bootloader increments the counter on every
        POWERON or EXT reset and triggers the reset actions when this value is
        reached.

config LCM_RESTART_COUNTER_TIMEOUT_MS
    int "Restart counter timeout window (ms)"
    range 1000 3600000
    default 5000
    help
        Defines how long the device waits for another restart before the
        consecutive restart counter is reset. Reduce the value if you want a
        shorter window to trigger the automatic factory reset, or increase it
        to make the sequence easier to perform.
