    help
        Defines how long the device waits for another restart before the
        consecutive restart counter is reset. Reduce the value if you want a
        shorter window to trigger the automatic factory reset, or increase it
        to make the sequence easier to perform.

    int "Hardware reset detection window (ms)"
    range 1000 60000

    help
        Number of milliseconds the Lifecycle Manager tracks consecutive
        hardware resets. Power-cycle the device this many times within the
        window to trigger the automatic factory rollback to the factory
        partition.

config LCM_HW_RESET_TARGET
    int "Hardware reset trigger count"
    range 2 50
    default 10
    help
        Number of hardware resets within the configured window required to
        perform a factory rollback. After reaching this count the device boots
        the factory partition and clears OTA metadata.
